KDED:
 * allow one-time and persistent authorization (right now we only do persistent)
 * be smart about allowing entire chain of devices (e.g. station + cable in
    single notification)

KCM
 * list of devices
 * only show peripherals
 * device details
 * authorize/enroll/forget each device
    -> with custom options
 * show smart grouping based on parent UID?

TESTS:
 * LIBS
    - check reading all properties works
    - check signals from daemon work
    - check all calls from lib to daemon work

 * KDED
    - check only unauthorized devices trigger the prompt
    - check authorization and enrolling works
    - check we don't crash when device disappears while we are showing ntf

 * KCM
    - ? hard to test, mostly GUI
